  Description: This module brdiges calls between extensible modules. This module was
  largely influenced by the AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming) Joint-Point concept. It is
  now possible to effectively monitor inter-module communication by simply monitoring
  the bridges.The only disadvantage of bridges is that it will to some degree reduce
  system efficiency because of the added overhead, by how much I am still not certain.
  Ideally all intermodule calls should go through the bridge, unfortunately, this 
  is still not completely implemented as of yet.
